# Welcome to GoodVibes!

Hi! GoodVibes is an project aimed towards enabling user-friendly and safe adult themed integrations for VR, and the idea is to enable these integrations without the creation of mods. 

All the work in this organization is being done on all members free time. If you're interested in this project or want to contribute in any way please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/R2tTCB7MNC).

## Open-source

This project will be partly open-source, and the parts that are will be licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. The focus on this project is to enable, and that includes enable you to make integrations towards our servers if you thing our client is lacking.

The members of this project prioritizes security and anonymity, something that tends to be a bit lacking specifically within the adult theme. We want you to be able to know what are running on your local machine and therefore what you are sending to our servers.

However, leaving the server-side closed-sourced enables us to make more adaptable integrations towards external-partners down the line, thus the decision of keeping it closed-source.
